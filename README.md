# PPT-Control-Using-Hand-gesture
PPT Control Using Hand Gesture is a project that allows you to control PowerPoint presentations using hand gestures. Instead of relying on traditional input devices like a keyboard or mouse, this project leverages computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures and map them to specific presentation commands.
